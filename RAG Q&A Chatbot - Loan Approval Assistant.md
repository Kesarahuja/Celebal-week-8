# RAG Q&A Chatbot - Loan Approval Assistant

## Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Q&A chatbot specifically designed for loan approval assistance. The chatbot can answer questions about loan applications, approval criteria, and specific loan data from the provided dataset.

## Live Demo

ðŸš€ **Deployed Application**: [https://lnh8imcj9y50.manus.space](https://lnh8imcj9y50.manus.space)

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Modern, responsive web interface with real-time messaging
- **Document Retrieval**: Intelligent document search and retrieval based on user queries
- **Contextual Responses**: AI-powered responses based on retrieved loan application data
- **Sample Questions**: Pre-built sample questions to help users get started
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## Architecture

### RAG System Components

1. **Document Preparation**: 
   - Loan application data from CSV files
   - Comprehensive documentation about loan features
   - Text preprocessing and chunking

2. **Retrieval System**:
   - Keyword-based similarity scoring
   - Document ranking and selection
   - Context extraction for relevant information

3. **Response Generation**:
   - Pattern-based response generation
   - Statistical analysis of loan data
   - Contextual information synthesis

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Data Processing**: CSV parsing, text processing
- **Deployment**: Manus Cloud Platform

## Dataset Information

The chatbot is trained on a loan approval dataset containing:

- **Training Dataset**: 614 loan applications with approval status
- **Test Dataset**: 367 loan applications without approval status

### Key Features Analyzed:
- Loan ID, Gender, Marital Status, Dependents
- Education Level, Employment Status
- Applicant Income, Co-applicant Income
- Loan Amount, Loan Term, Credit History
- Property Area, Loan Status (Y/N)

## Sample Queries

The chatbot can answer questions like:

1. **"What factors affect loan approval?"**
   - Returns comprehensive information about loan approval criteria

2. **"What is the loan status for LP001003?"**
   - Provides specific loan application status

3. **"How many applicants are self-employed?"**
   - Statistical analysis of employment status in the dataset

4. **"What is the average loan amount?"**
   - Calculates and returns average loan amounts from the data
